====================================

This example demonstrates the FME Server Data Download service and the power of integrating it with Open Layers and Open Street Map. This example application provides an interface for the user to select a study area by drawing a polygon. Once the polygon is drawn, the user can continue building up a request by selecting the layers they wish to download and the format and coordinate system of the returned data. The request is then sent to FME Server which processes it and returns the data to the user.
